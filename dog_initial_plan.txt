Phase 1: Start at point (25,25) and wait for a message from the adaptive planning module with the identifier of the 10x10 meters square containing the ball.
Phase 2: Upon receiving the message, move to the center of the identified square and start a spiral search algorithm to scan the area. The spiral search will involve moving in a circular pattern, starting from the center and increasing the radius by 2 meters after each complete circle.
Phase 3: Continue the spiral search until the ball is detected. Once detected, move to the ball's location and pick it up.
Phase 4: After picking up the ball, navigate back to the starting point (25,25) using a shortest path algorithm.

Spiral Search Algorithm:
- Start at the center of the square (x, y)
- Set the initial radius to 2 meters
- Move in a circular pattern around the center, scanning the area within the current radius
- If the ball is not detected, increase the radius by 2 meters and repeat the circular pattern
- Continue increasing the radius and scanning until the ball is detected or the entire square has been covered

Adaptive Planning Module:
- Receive messages from the drone with the identifier of the square containing the ball
- Send messages to the dog with the identifier of the square containing the ball
- Receive messages from the dog when the ball has been picked up and the mission is complete
