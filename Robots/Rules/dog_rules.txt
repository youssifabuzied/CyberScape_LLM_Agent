"""
- ONLY use the functions provided in the specification for the robot dog. Do not invent or assume additional functions.
- NO while loops and NO recursive calls.
- Each phase must be independent, executing only after the previous phase completes.
- If the robot dog needs to wait, explicitly include an idle state.
- Every movement must be verified using `if RobotDog.has_reached(X, Y):` before proceeding.
- You are responsible for the translation of the high-level plan of the robot dog into a low-level set of executable robot dog instructions using ONLY the provided instructions. You won't be doing anything for the drone.  
- You can use the set of Input variables for a given phase and pass them when calling the functions you use in the low-level plan if needed. However, you should place the variables between those symboles <>. For example, Drone.move_to(<x>, <y>)
