"""
- ONLY use the functions provided in the specification for the drone. Do not invent or assume additional functions.
- NO while loops and NO recursive calls.
- Each phase must be independent, executing only after the previous phase completes.
- If the drone needs to wait, explicitly include an idle state.
- You are responsible for the translation of the high-level plan of the drone into a low-level set of executable drone instructions using ONLY the provided instructions. You won't be doing anything for the robot dog.  
- You can use the set of Input variables for a given phase for the functions if needed. However, you should place the variables between those symboles <>. For example, Drone.move_to(<x>, <y>)
