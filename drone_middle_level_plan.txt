**Middle-Level Drone Plan:**

**Phase 1: Initial Scan and Grid Setup**

1. Take off from the initial position (5,5) and ascend to a suitable altitude for scanning the 50x50 meter field.
2. Divide the 50x50 meter field into 25 squares, each measuring 10x10 meters.
3. Create a grid pattern to systematically scan each 10x10 meter square, starting from the top-left corner (0,0) and moving right and then down.
4. Initialize a scanning sequence to ensure that each square is scanned only once.

**Phase 2: Systematic Scanning and Ball Detection**

1. Begin scanning the first 10x10 meter square in the grid pattern.
2. Use onboard sensors to detect the presence of the ball within the current square.
3. If the ball is not detected, move to the next 10x10 meter square in the grid pattern and repeat the scanning process.
4. Continue scanning each square until the ball is detected or the entire field has been scanned.
5. Record the coordinates of the 10x10 meter square where the ball is detected.

**Phase 3: Communication with Robot Dog**

1. Once the 10x10 meter square with the ball is identified, communicate the coordinates to the robot dog via the adaptive planning module.
2. Provide additional information, such as the approximate location of the ball within the square, if available.
3. Confirm receipt of the coordinates by the robot dog and ensure that it understands the next steps.

**Phase 4: Real-Time Guidance and Support**

1. Hover above the identified 10x10 meter square to provide real-time guidance to the robot dog if needed.
2. Monitor the robot dog's progress and adjust the drone's position as necessary to maintain line-of-sight communication.
3. Continue to provide guidance and support until the robot dog has successfully retrieved the ball and returned to the starting point (25,25).

**Contingency Planning**

1. Establish a protocol for handling communication disruptions or failures between the drone and the robot dog.
2. Develop a plan for re-scanning the area if the ball is not found or if the robot dog is unable to retrieve it.
3. Identify alternative strategies for completing the mission if unforeseen obstacles or challenges arise.
