**Middle-Level Drone Plan:**

**Phase 1: Initial Scan and Grid Setup**

1. Take off from the initial position (5,5) and ascend to a suitable altitude for scanning the 50x50 meter field.
2. Divide the 50x50 meter field into 25 squares, each measuring 10x10 meters.
3. Create a grid pattern to systematically scan each 10x10 meter square, starting from the top-left corner (0,0) and moving right and then down.
4. Initialize a scanning route to cover all 25 squares, ensuring that each square is scanned only once.

**Phase 2: Systematic Scanning and Ball Detection**

1. Begin scanning the first 10x10 meter square in the grid pattern.
2. Use onboard sensors to detect the presence of the ball within the current square.
3. If the ball is not detected, move to the next square in the grid pattern and repeat the scanning process.
4. Continue scanning each square until the ball is detected or all 25 squares have been scanned.
5. If the ball is detected, record the coordinates of the 10x10 meter square containing the ball.

**Phase 3: Communication with Robot Dog**

1. Communicate the coordinates of the 10x10 meter square containing the ball to the robot dog via the adaptive planning module.
2. Provide any additional relevant information, such as the approximate location of the ball within the square.

**Phase 4: Real-Time Guidance**

1. Hover above the identified 10x10 meter square to provide real-time guidance to the robot dog if needed.
2. Monitor the robot dog's progress and provide updates on the ball's location as necessary.
3. Ensure all communication with the robot dog is routed through the adaptive planning module.

**Phase 5: Mission Completion**

1. Once the robot dog has retrieved the ball and returned to the starting point (25,25), confirm mission completion.
2. Return to the initial position (5,5) and land safely.
