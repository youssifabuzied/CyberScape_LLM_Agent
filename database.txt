ZIGZAG SCANNING ALGORITHM:
--------------------------
The Zigzag scanning algorithm is a coverage strategy where the agent (robot or drone) moves back and forth across the field, shifting slightly after each full-length pass. 
This method is deterministic, simple, and optimal in open, rectangular spaces. Its efficiency depends on minimal turning cost and predictable obstacles. 
It is often used in agricultural robots, autonomous vacuums, and systematic surveillance.

1. Start at the origin of the grid.
2. Move in the X-direction to the boundary.
3. Shift up/down by the scanning width (e.g., 1 or 2 meters).
4. Move in the reverse X-direction.
5. Repeat until the entire field is covered.

SPIRAL OUTWARD SCAN:
--------------------
The Spiral Scan starts at the center or a specific point and expands outward in an ever-widening spiral.
Effective in smaller environments where central placement is possible.
Used in bomb detection, lawn coverage, or small field surveys.

1. Start at center point.
2. Move right 1 unit, then up 1 unit.
3. Move left 2 units, then down 2 units.
4. Move right 3 units, up 3 units, and so on...

BOUSTROPHEDON DECOMPOSITION:
----------------------------
A form of zigzag scanning where the space is first decomposed into simple cells using a vertical line sweep. 
Then each cell is covered using a boustrophedon path.
Useful in irregular environments.

1. Divide space into cells using vertical sweep.
2. For each cell:
   - Follow a zigzag pattern.
3. Skip areas with obstacles or known unreachable areas.

LAWN MOWER ALGORITHM:
---------------------
The lawn mower pattern is a common strategy in autonomous vehicle navigation for field coverage. 
It follows a back-and-forth route across the full extent of the field in long, narrow rows.
This ensures complete coverage with minimal overlapping.

SENSOR SWEEPING METHOD:
-----------------------
Sweeping methods involve rotating or shifting the sensor or camera array as the robot or drone moves forward.
These methods are used when the sensor has a wide field of view (FOV) and can cover more than its immediate location.

RANDOM WALK SCAN:
-----------------
A stochastic scanning algorithm used when no prior map is available.
It relies on random direction changes, useful in highly dynamic environments.
While not optimal in coverage time, it is easy to implement.

FRONTIER-BASED EXPLORATION:
---------------------------
Frontier-based exploration is used in SLAM-based robots.
Frontiers are defined as the boundary between explored and unexplored regions.

1. Identify frontier cells.
2. Select the closest or most informative frontier.
3. Navigate to frontier.
4. Update map and repeat.

INFORMATION-THEORETIC SCAN:
---------------------------
This method selects the next scanning location based on the expected information gain (entropy reduction).
Popular in autonomous mapping and environmental sampling.

POTENTIAL FIELD-BASED COVERAGE:
-------------------------------
Inspired by electromagnetics, virtual attractive and repulsive fields are created.
The robot is attracted to uncovered space and repelled from obstacles and visited areas.

COVERAGE-AWARE A* SEARCH:
-------------------------
A variation of the A* algorithm that prioritizes unexplored or partially scanned cells when computing the shortest path.

1. Use a priority queue ordered by cost + heuristic + coverage weight.
2. Each node stores information about whether it's been scanned.
3. Favor nodes that reduce unvisited area.

Then each cell is covered using a boustrophedon path.
Useful in irregular environments.

1. Divide space into cells using vertical sweep.
2. For each cell:
   - Follow a zigzag pattern.
3. Skip areas with obstacles or known unreachable areas.

LAWN MOWER ALGORITHM:
---------------------
The lawn mower pattern is a common strategy in autonomous vehicle navigation for field coverage. 
It follows a back-and-forth route across the full extent of the field in long, narrow rows.
This ensures complete coverage with minimal overlapping.

SENSOR SWEEPING METHOD:
-----------------------
Sweeping methods involve rotating or shifting the sensor or camera array as the robot or drone moves forward.
These methods are used when the sensor has a wide field of view (FOV) and can cover more than its immediate location.

RANDOM WALK SCAN:
-----------------
A stochastic scanning algorithm used when no prior map is available.
It relies on random direction changes, useful in highly dynamic environments.
While not optimal in coverage time, it is easy to implement.

FRONTIER-BASED EXPLORATION:
---------------------------
Frontier-based exploration is used in SLAM-based robots.
Frontiers are defined as the boundary between explored and unexplored regions.

1. Identify frontier cells.
2. Select the closest or most informative frontier.
3. Navigate to frontier.
4. Update map and repeat.

INFORMATION-THEORETIC SCAN:
---------------------------
This method selects the next scanning location based on the expected information gain (entropy reduction).
Popular in autonomous mapping and environmental sampling.

POTENTIAL FIELD-BASED COVERAGE:
-------------------------------
Inspired by electromagnetics, virtual attractive and repulsive fields are created.
The robot is attracted to uncovered space and repelled from obstacles and visited areas.

COVERAGE-AWARE A* SEARCH:
-------------------------
A variation of the A* algorithm that prioritizes unexplored or partially scanned cells when computing the shortest path.

1. Use a priority queue ordered by cost + heuristic + coverage weight.
2. Each node stores information about whether it's been scanned.
3. Favor nodes that reduce unvisited area.

[Repeated below multiple times to increase file size...]

ZIGZAG SCANNING ALGORITHM:
--------------------------
The Zigzag scanning algorithm is a coverage strategy where the agent (robot or drone) moves back and forth across the field, shifting slightly after each full-length pass. 
This method is deterministic, simple, and optimal in open, rectangular spaces. Its efficiency depends on minimal turning cost and predictable obstacles. 
It is often used in agricultural robots, autonomous vacuums, and systematic surveillance.

1. Start at the origin of the grid.
2. Move in the X-direction to the boundary.
3. Shift up/down by the scanning width (e.g., 1 or 2 meters).
4. Move in the reverse X-direction.
5. Repeat until the entire field is covered.

SPIRAL OUTWARD SCAN:
--------------------
The Spiral Scan starts at the center or a specific point and expands outward in an ever-widening spiral.
Effective in smaller environments where central placement is possible.
Used in bomb detection, lawn coverage, or small field surveys.

1. Start at center point.
2. Move right 1 unit, then up 1 unit.
3. Move left 2 units, then down 2 units.
4. Move right 3 units, up 3 units, and so on...

4. Update map and repeat.

INFORMATION-THEORETIC SCAN:
---------------------------
This method selects the next scanning location based on the expected information gain (entropy reduction).
Popular in autonomous mapping and environmental sampling.

POTENTIAL FIELD-BASED COVERAGE:
-------------------------------
Inspired by electromagnetics, virtual attractive and repulsive fields are created.
The robot is attracted to uncovered space and repelled from obstacles and visited areas.

COVERAGE-AWARE A* SEARCH:
-------------------------
A variation of the A* algorithm that prioritizes unexplored or partially scanned cells when computing the shortest path.

1. Use a priority queue ordered by cost + heuristic + coverage weight.
2. Each node stores information about whether it's been scanned.
3. Favor nodes that reduce unvisited area.

[Repeated below multiple times to increase file size...]

ZIGZAG SCANNING ALGORITHM:
--------------------------
The Zigzag scanning algorithm is a coverage strategy where the agent (robot or drone) moves back and forth across the field, shifting slightly after each full-length pass. 
This method is deterministic, simple, and optimal in open, rectangular spaces. Its efficiency depends on minimal turning cost and predictable obstacles. 
It is often used in agricultural robots, autonomous vacuums, and systematic surveillance.

1. Start at the origin of the grid.
2. Move in the X-direction to the boundary.
3. Shift up/down by the scanning width (e.g., 1 or 2 meters).
4. Move in the reverse X-direction.
5. Repeat until the entire field is covered.

SPIRAL OUTWARD SCAN:
--------------------
The Spiral Scan starts at the center or a specific point and expands outward in an ever-widening spiral.
Effective in smaller environments where central placement is possible.
Used in bomb detection, lawn coverage, or small field surveys.

1. Start at center point.
2. Move right 1 unit, then up 1 unit.
3. Move left 2 units, then down 2 units.
4. Move right 3 units, up 3 units, and so on...

BOUSTROPHEDON DECOMPOSITION:
----------------------------
A form of zigzag scanning where the space is first decomposed into simple cells using a vertical line sweep. 
Then each cell is covered using a boustrophedon path.
Useful in irregular environments.

1. Divide space into cells using vertical sweep.
2. For each cell:
   - Follow a zigzag pattern.
3. Skip areas with obstacles or known unreachable areas.

LAWN MOWER ALGORITHM:
---------------------
The lawn mower pattern is a common strategy in autonomous vehicle navigation for field coverage. 
It follows a back-and-forth route across the full extent of the field in long, narrow rows.
This ensures complete coverage with minimal overlapping.

SENSOR SWEEPING METHOD:
-----------------------
Sweeping methods involve rotating or shifting the sensor or camera array as the robot or drone moves forward.
These methods are used when the sensor has a wide field of view (FOV) and can cover more than its immediate location.

RANDOM WALK SCAN:
-----------------
A stochastic scanning algorithm used when no prior map is available.
It relies on random direction changes, useful in highly dynamic environments.
While not optimal in coverage time, it is easy to implement.

FRONTIER-BASED EXPLORATION:
---------------------------
Frontier-based exploration is used in SLAM-based robots.
Frontiers are defined as the boundary between explored and unexplored regions.

1. Identify frontier cells.
2. Select the closest or most informative frontier.
3. Navigate to frontier.
4. Update map and repeat.

3. Shift up/down by the scanning width (e.g., 1 or 2 meters).
4. Move in the reverse X-direction.
5. Repeat until the entire field is covered.

SPIRAL OUTWARD SCAN:
--------------------
The Spiral Scan starts at the center or a specific point and expands outward in an ever-widening spiral.
Effective in smaller environments where central placement is possible.
Used in bomb detection, lawn coverage, or small field surveys.

1. Start at center point.
2. Move right 1 unit, then up 1 unit.
3. Move left 2 units, then down 2 units.
4. Move right 3 units, up 3 units, and so on...

BOUSTROPHEDON DECOMPOSITION:
----------------------------
A form of zigzag scanning where the space is first decomposed into simple cells using a vertical line sweep. 
Then each cell is covered using a boustrophedon path.
Useful in irregular environments.

1. Divide space into cells using vertical sweep.
2. For each cell:
   - Follow a zigzag pattern.
3. Skip areas with obstacles or known unreachable areas.

LAWN MOWER ALGORITHM:
---------------------
The lawn mower pattern is a common strategy in autonomous vehicle navigation for field coverage. 
It follows a back-and-forth route across the full extent of the field in long, narrow rows.
This ensures complete coverage with minimal overlapping.

SENSOR SWEEPING METHOD:
-----------------------
Sweeping methods involve rotating or shifting the sensor or camera array as the robot or drone moves forward.
These methods are used when the sensor has a wide field of view (FOV) and can cover more than its immediate location.

RANDOM WALK SCAN:
-----------------
A stochastic scanning algorithm used when no prior map is available.
It relies on random direction changes, useful in highly dynamic environments.
While not optimal in coverage time, it is easy to implement.

FRONTIER-BASED EXPLORATION:
---------------------------
Frontier-based exploration is used in SLAM-based robots.
Frontiers are defined as the boundary between explored and unexplored regions.

1. Identify frontier cells.
2. Select the closest or most informative frontier.
3. Navigate to frontier.
4. Update map and repeat.

INFORMATION-THEORETIC SCAN:
---------------------------
This method selects the next scanning location based on the expected information gain (entropy reduction).
Popular in autonomous mapping and environmental sampling.

POTENTIAL FIELD-BASED COVERAGE:
-------------------------------
Inspired by electromagnetics, virtual attractive and repulsive fields are created.
The robot is attracted to uncovered space and repelled from obstacles and visited areas.

COVERAGE-AWARE A* SEARCH:
-------------------------
A variation of the A* algorithm that prioritizes unexplored or partially scanned cells when computing the shortest path.

1. Use a priority queue ordered by cost + heuristic + coverage weight.
2. Each node stores information about whether it's been scanned.
3. Favor nodes that reduce unvisited area.

[Repeated below multiple times to increase file size...]

ZIGZAG SCANNING ALGORITHM:
--------------------------
The Zigzag scanning algorithm is a coverage strategy where the agent (robot or drone) moves back and forth across the field, shifting slightly after each full-length pass. 
This method is deterministic, simple, and optimal in open, rectangular spaces. Its efficiency depends on minimal turning cost and predictable obstacles. 
It is often used in agricultural robots, autonomous vacuums, and systematic surveillance.

1. Start at the origin of the grid.
2. Move in the X-direction to the boundary.
3. Shift up/down by the scanning width (e.g., 1 or 2 meters).
4. Move in the reverse X-direction.

It follows a back-and-forth route across the full extent of the field in long, narrow rows.
This ensures complete coverage with minimal overlapping.

SENSOR SWEEPING METHOD:
-----------------------
Sweeping methods involve rotating or shifting the sensor or camera array as the robot or drone moves forward.
These methods are used when the sensor has a wide field of view (FOV) and can cover more than its immediate location.

RANDOM WALK SCAN:
-----------------
A stochastic scanning algorithm used when no prior map is available.
It relies on random direction changes, useful in highly dynamic environments.
While not optimal in coverage time, it is easy to implement.

FRONTIER-BASED EXPLORATION:
---------------------------
Frontier-based exploration is used in SLAM-based robots.
Frontiers are defined as the boundary between explored and unexplored regions.

1. Identify frontier cells.
2. Select the closest or most informative frontier.
3. Navigate to frontier.
4. Update map and repeat.

INFORMATION-THEORETIC SCAN:
---------------------------
This method selects the next scanning location based on the expected information gain (entropy reduction).
Popular in autonomous mapping and environmental sampling.

POTENTIAL FIELD-BASED COVERAGE:
-------------------------------
Inspired by electromagnetics, virtual attractive and repulsive fields are created.
The robot is attracted to uncovered space and repelled from obstacles and visited areas.

COVERAGE-AWARE A* SEARCH:
-------------------------
A variation of the A* algorithm that prioritizes unexplored or partially scanned cells when computing the shortest path.

1. Use a priority queue ordered by cost + heuristic + coverage weight.
2. Each node stores information about whether it's been scanned.
3. Favor nodes that reduce unvisited area.

[Repeated below multiple times to increase file size...]

ZIGZAG SCANNING ALGORITHM:
--------------------------
The Zigzag scanning algorithm is a coverage strategy where the agent (robot or drone) moves back and forth across the field, shifting slightly after each full-length pass. 
This method is deterministic, simple, and optimal in open, rectangular spaces. Its efficiency depends on minimal turning cost and predictable obstacles. 
It is often used in agricultural robots, autonomous vacuums, and systematic surveillance.

1. Start at the origin of the grid.
2. Move in the X-direction to the boundary.
3. Shift up/down by the scanning width (e.g., 1 or 2 meters).
4. Move in the reverse X-direction.
5. Repeat until the entire field is covered.

SPIRAL OUTWARD SCAN:
--------------------
The Spiral Scan starts at the center or a specific point and expands outward in an ever-widening spiral.
Effective in smaller environments where central placement is possible.
Used in bomb detection, lawn coverage, or small field surveys.

1. Start at center point.
2. Move right 1 unit, then up 1 unit.
3. Move left 2 units, then down 2 units.
4. Move right 3 units, up 3 units, and so on...

BOUSTROPHEDON DECOMPOSITION:
----------------------------
A form of zigzag scanning where the space is first decomposed into simple cells using a vertical line sweep. 
Then each cell is covered using a boustrophedon path.
Useful in irregular environments.

1. Divide space into cells using vertical sweep.
2. For each cell:
   - Follow a zigzag pattern.
3. Skip areas with obstacles or known unreachable areas.

-------------------------
A variation of the A* algorithm that prioritizes unexplored or partially scanned cells when computing the shortest path.

1. Use a priority queue ordered by cost + heuristic + coverage weight.
2. Each node stores information about whether it's been scanned.
3. Favor nodes that reduce unvisited area.

[Repeated below multiple times to increase file size...]

ZIGZAG SCANNING ALGORITHM:
--------------------------
The Zigzag scanning algorithm is a coverage strategy where the agent (robot or drone) moves back and forth across the field, shifting slightly after each full-length pass. 
This method is deterministic, simple, and optimal in open, rectangular spaces. Its efficiency depends on minimal turning cost and predictable obstacles. 
It is often used in agricultural robots, autonomous vacuums, and systematic surveillance.

1. Start at the origin of the grid.
2. Move in the X-direction to the boundary.
3. Shift up/down by the scanning width (e.g., 1 or 2 meters).
4. Move in the reverse X-direction.
5. Repeat until the entire field is covered.

SPIRAL OUTWARD SCAN:
--------------------
The Spiral Scan starts at the center or a specific point and expands outward in an ever-widening spiral.
Effective in smaller environments where central placement is possible.
Used in bomb detection, lawn coverage, or small field surveys.

1. Start at center point.
2. Move right 1 unit, then up 1 unit.
3. Move left 2 units, then down 2 units.
4. Move right 3 units, up 3 units, and so on...

BOUSTROPHEDON DECOMPOSITION:
----------------------------
A form of zigzag scanning where the space is first decomposed into simple cells using a vertical line sweep. 
Then each cell is covered using a boustrophedon path.
Useful in irregular environments.

1. Divide space into cells using vertical sweep.
2. For each cell:
   - Follow a zigzag pattern.
3. Skip areas with obstacles or known unreachable areas.

LAWN MOWER ALGORITHM:
---------------------
The lawn mower pattern is a common strategy in autonomous vehicle navigation for field coverage. 
It follows a back-and-forth route across the full extent of the field in long, narrow rows.
This ensures complete coverage with minimal overlapping.

SENSOR SWEEPING METHOD:
-----------------------
Sweeping methods involve rotating or shifting the sensor or camera array as the robot or drone moves forward.
These methods are used when the sensor has a wide field of view (FOV) and can cover more than its immediate location.

RANDOM WALK SCAN:
-----------------
A stochastic scanning algorithm used when no prior map is available.
It relies on random direction changes, useful in highly dynamic environments.
While not optimal in coverage time, it is easy to implement.

FRONTIER-BASED EXPLORATION:
---------------------------
Frontier-based exploration is used in SLAM-based robots.
Frontiers are defined as the boundary between explored and unexplored regions.

1. Identify frontier cells.
2. Select the closest or most informative frontier.
3. Navigate to frontier.
4. Update map and repeat.

INFORMATION-THEORETIC SCAN:
---------------------------
This method selects the next scanning location based on the expected information gain (entropy reduction).
Popular in autonomous mapping and environmental sampling.

POTENTIAL FIELD-BASED COVERAGE:
-------------------------------
Inspired by electromagnetics, virtual attractive and repulsive fields are created.
The robot is attracted to uncovered space and repelled from obstacles and visited areas.
