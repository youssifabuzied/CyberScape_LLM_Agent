Phase 1: Divide the 50x50 meters field into 25 squares of 10x10 meters each and assign a unique identifier to each square.
Phase 2: Start scanning the squares in a systematic order (e.g., left to right, top to bottom), beginning from the top-left square (0,0).
Phase 3: Once the drone detects the ball in a square, communicate the identifier of that square to the robot dog through the adaptive planning module and stop scanning.
