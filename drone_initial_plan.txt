Phase 1: Take off from the initial position (5,5) and begin scanning the 50x50 meter field in a grid pattern, dividing it into 10x10 meter squares.
Phase 2: Systematically scan each 10x10 meter square to identify the one containing the ball.
Phase 3: Once the 10x10 meter square with the ball is identified, communicate the coordinates to the robot dog via the adaptive planning module.
Phase 4: Hover above the identified 10x10 meter square to provide real-time guidance to the robot dog if needed, ensuring all communication is routed through the adaptive planning module.
