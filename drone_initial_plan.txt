Phase 1: Fly to point (0,0) and start scanning the 10x10 meters square area.
Phase 2: If the ball is not found, move 10 meters to the right (east direction) and scan the next 10x10 meters square area.
Phase 3: Continue moving 10 meters to the right and scanning until the entire row is covered.
Phase 4: Move 10 meters up (north direction) and repeat phases 2-3 until the entire field is covered.
Phase 5: Once the ball is located within a 10x10 meters square, communicate the coordinates to the robot dog.
