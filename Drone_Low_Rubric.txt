Correctness of Translation

    Does every step in the low-level plan accurately reflect the corresponding step in the middle-level plan?
    Are all function calls correctly used without modification or misinterpretation?
    Is the sequence of execution maintained as specified in the middle-level plan?

Exhaustive Coverage of the Middle-Level Plan

    Does the low-level plan include all steps from the middle-level plan without skipping any details?
    Is every phase from the middle-level plan translated into a corresponding low-level execution block?
    Are all necessary operations accounted for in the low-level instructions?

Adherence to Specified Actions

    Are only the functions listed in the drone specifications used?
    Is there any use of assumed or additional functions that are not explicitly provided?
    Does each action in the low-level plan correspond strictly to the predefined functions?

Format Consistency

    Does the plan consist only of executable instructions without comments or explanations?
    Is the output structured cleanly without unnecessary text or annotations?
    Does the plan maintain a consistent format without deviations from the expected style?
    Does the generated plan stick only to instructions without adding any notes or comments?
