move_to_point((x,y,z)) // move to specific coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude)
rotate(angle) // rotate angle degrees
detect_with_camera(object) // detect objects with the camera, return position and detection status which is boolean
wait_for_signal() // wait for a signal to continue
communicate_with_apm(data) // communicate with the Adaptive Planning Module (APM) to send any type of data
fly(height) // fly to a specified altitude
return_to_base() // return the drone to its base position
Remarks:
When waiting for information from the dog, wait_for_signal should be used.
When scanning an area, detect_with_camera should be called after each movement until detection.
Use detect_with_camera when you are scanning with the intention of detecting something.
If you want to communicate a given square to the apm, you should send the coordinates of the center of the square, this is the identifier of the square.
Do not use excessive indentation in the generated plan.
Any scanning should be done in one phase and not distributed on separate phases.
