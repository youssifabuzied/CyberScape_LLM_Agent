Mission Scenario: We have a drone and a robot dog. We also have a mission to pick up a ball from a field of size 50x50 meters. The goal is to locate a ball residing in a 1x1 cell. The drone can fly over the field and can determine the 10x10 meters square having the ball. The drone can only scan 10x10 meters squares not less than that; that's why it can only identify the 10x10 meters block having the ball and not the exact 1x1 location. The drone is initially located at point (5,5). The dog robot must locate the exact 1x1 meters square having the ball, get to the ball, and bring it back to the starting point located at point (25,25). The robot dog and the drone share their detection information, so, for example, if the drone found the ball at some block, the dog will have this information to use automatically without calling anything. The drone or the dog might want to either wait for information from the other robot or do something while waiting. The dog can only scan up to 2 meters in all directions. So, for example, if it is located at x = 10, it can see the range of x = 8 to x = 12 only and same for the y direction, so the dog basically scans up to 2x2 meters squares. The drone should follow a systematic approach to cover the whole field area, and both robots must collaborate to complete the mission efficiently.
