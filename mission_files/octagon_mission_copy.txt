Plan a mission where the robot dog starts at a specified point on the perimeter of a uniform octagon and
navigates around it,completing a full circuit. The octagon has a side length of 10 units. Provide clear,
step-by-step instructions for the robot dog to execute this task. The dog will start at point  (20,20)
which is  a vertex on the octagon. You should use only the move forward and rotate functions for the robot dog.
The done should monitr the progress of the robot dog and send its coordinates frequently to the adaptive planning module.
