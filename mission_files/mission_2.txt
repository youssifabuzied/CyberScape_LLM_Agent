Mission:
A drone and a robot dog need to work together to locate and deliver a lost key inside a 30x30 meter warehouse.

Details:

    The drone can fly over the warehouse and identify a 5x5 meter section where the key is located. It starts at (3,3) and follows a systematic scanning approach.
    Once the keyâ€™s approximate location is identified, the drone will notify the robot dog.
    The robot dog starts at (15,15) and can scan 1 meter in all directions. It must search the identified section, find the key, and carry it to the exit at (0,0).
    The drone and the robot dog must communicate efficiently to minimize search time.

Objective:
The mission is completed when the robot dog delivers the key to the exit point.
