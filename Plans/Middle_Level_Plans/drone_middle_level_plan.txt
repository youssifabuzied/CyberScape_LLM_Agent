Since the drone is not required to do anything in this mission, the middle-level plan will focus on the actions of the robot dog. Here's the breakdown:

**Middle-Level Plan:**

**Phase 1: Initialization**
The robot dog starts at a designated location, which will be the starting point of the square path.

**Phase 2: Move Forward**
The robot dog moves forward by a distance of 2 units, which is the side length of the square.

**Phase 3: Turn Left**
The robot dog turns left by 90 degrees to prepare for the next side of the square.

**Phase 4: Move Forward**
The robot dog moves forward by a distance of 2 units, completing the second side of the square.

**Phase 5: Turn Left**
The robot dog turns left by 90 degrees to prepare for the next side of the square.

**Phase 6: Move Forward**
The robot dog moves forward by a distance of 2 units, completing the third side of the square.

**Phase 7: Turn Left**
The robot dog turns left by 90 degrees to prepare for the final side of the square.

**Phase 8: Move Forward**
The robot dog moves forward by a distance of 2 units, completing the final side of the square and returning to the starting point.

**Phase 9: Mission Completion**
The robot dog has successfully completed the mission by moving in a counterclockwise square path of side length 2.
