**Middle-Level Drone Plan:**

**Phase 1: Initialization and Grid Division**

1. The drone starts at the initial location (5,5) and orients itself with the field's boundaries.
2. Divide the 50x50 meters field into 25 non-overlapping 10x10 meters squares, creating a 5x5 grid.
3. Assign a unique identifier to each square for easy reference and communication with the robot dog.

**Phase 2: Systematic Grid Scanning**

1. The drone begins scanning the squares in a systematic pattern, starting from the top-left square (0,0) and moving right, then down to the next row.
2. For each square, the drone flies to the center and uses its sensors to detect the presence of the ball.
3. If the ball is detected in a square, the drone records the square's identifier and proceeds to the next phase.

**Phase 3: Communication with the Robot Dog**

1. The drone communicates the identifier of the square containing the ball to the robot dog.
2. The drone provides the robot dog with the approximate location of the ball within the 10x10 meters square.

**Phase 4: Support and Oversight**

1. The drone observes the robot dog's movement and provides guidance if necessary.
2. If the robot dog requires additional assistance or clarification on the ball's location, the drone provides support through communication.

**Middle-Level Robot Dog Plan:**

**Phase 1: Initialization and Scanning Preparation**

1. The robot dog starts at the initial location (25,25) and orients itself with the field's boundaries.
2. Receive communication from the drone regarding the 10x10 meters square containing the ball.

**Phase 2: Scanning and Localization**

1. The robot dog moves to the center of the specified 10x10 meters square.
2. Begin scanning the area, using its 2-meter range sensors to detect the ball in all directions.
3. Move in a pattern to cover the entire 10x10 meters square, adjusting its scanning area as needed.

**Phase 3: Ball Retrieval and Return**

1. Once the ball is detected, the robot dog moves to the ball's location and retrieves it.
2. The robot dog returns to the starting point (25,25) with the ball, completing the mission.

**Phase 4: Mission Completion and Communication**

1. The robot dog communicates its success to the drone.
2. The robot dog and drone may perform any additional tasks or return to their respective bases.
