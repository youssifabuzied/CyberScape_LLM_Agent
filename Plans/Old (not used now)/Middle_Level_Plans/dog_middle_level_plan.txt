**Middle-Level Plan for Robot Dog:**

**Phase 1: Initial Movement and Scanning**

1. Move to the starting location (25, 25) and orient itself to face the direction of the 10x10 meters square indicated by the drone.
2. Begin scanning the area within a 2-meter radius in all directions (x and y) to detect the ball.
3. If the ball is detected, proceed to Phase 7 for retrieval and return.
4. If the ball is not detected, continue to Phase 2.

**Phase 2: First Side of the Square**

1. Move forward by 2 units in the current direction to form the first side of the scanning square.
2. Continue scanning the area within a 2-meter radius in all directions (x and y) to detect the ball.
3. If the ball is detected, proceed to Phase 7 for retrieval and return.
4. If the ball is not detected, turn left by 90 degrees to prepare for the next side.

**Phase 3: Second Side of the Square**

1. Move forward by 2 units in the new direction to form the second side of the scanning square.
2. Continue scanning the area within a 2-meter radius in all directions (x and y) to detect the ball.
3. If the ball is detected, proceed to Phase 7 for retrieval and return.
4. If the ball is not detected, turn left by 90 degrees to prepare for the next side.

**Phase 4: Third Side of the Square**

1. Move forward by 2 units in the new direction to form the third side of the scanning square.
2. Continue scanning the area within a 2-meter radius in all directions (x and y) to detect the ball.
3. If the ball is detected, proceed to Phase 7 for retrieval and return.
4. If the ball is not detected, turn left by 90 degrees to prepare for the final side.

**Phase 5: Fourth Side of the Square**

1. Move forward by 2 units in the new direction to form the fourth side of the scanning square.
2. Continue scanning the area within a 2-meter radius in all directions (x and y) to detect the ball.
3. If the ball is detected, proceed to Phase 7 for retrieval and return.
4. If the ball is not detected, proceed to Phase 6.

**Phase 6: Return to Starting Point**

1. Move back to the starting location (25, 25) to re-orient and re-scan the area if necessary.
2. If the ball is still not detected, communicate with the drone to re-evaluate the 10x10 meters square.

**Phase 7: Ball Retrieval and Return**

1. Move towards the detected ball location.
2. Retrieve the ball.
3. Return to the starting location (25, 25) with the ball.

**High-Level Plan for Drone:**

1. Divide the 50x50 meters field into 25 10x10 meters squares.
2. Systematically fly over each square, starting from the top-left corner (0, 0) and moving right and then down.
3. Use sensors to detect the presence of the ball in each square.
4. Once the ball is detected in a square, communicate the square's coordinates to the robot dog.
5. Continue to monitor the area and provide updates to the robot dog as necessary.

**Collaboration Plan:**

1. The drone and robot dog establish communication at the start of the mission.
2. The drone provides the robot dog with the coordinates of the 10x10 meters square where the ball is detected.
3. The robot dog uses these coordinates to move to the starting location (25, 25) and begin scanning the area.
4. The drone continues to monitor the area and provide updates to the robot dog as necessary.
5. The robot dog retrieves the ball and returns to the starting location (25, 25).
6. The mission is complete when the robot dog returns with the ball.
