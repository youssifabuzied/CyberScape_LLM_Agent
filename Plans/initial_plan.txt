Drone Plan:
Phase 1: Systematic Field Coverage
- The drone will employ the Lawn Mower Algorithm to systematically cover the entire 50x50 meter field.
- Starting at point (5,5), the drone will fly in a back-and-forth pattern, covering 10-meter wide strips.
- The drone will move from (5,5) to (45,5), then shift 10 meters up to (45,15), and fly back to (5,15).
- This pattern will continue until the entire field is covered, ensuring that each 10x10 meter section is scanned for the presence of the ball.

Phase 2: Communication with Robot Dog
- Once the drone identifies the 10x10 meter square containing the ball, it will communicate the coordinates of this square to the robot dog.
- The drone will provide the starting point for the dog within the identified 10x10 meter area to optimize the search.

Dog Plan:
Phase 1: Initial Positioning
- The robot dog will start at its initial position (25,25).
- Upon receiving the coordinates of the 10x10 meter square from the drone, the dog will move directly to the center of this square to begin its search.

Phase 2: Detailed Search and Retrieval
- The robot dog will perform a detailed search within the 10x10 meter square using its 2-meter scanning capability.
- It will employ a grid search pattern, moving systematically to cover the entire area.
- Once the ball is located, the robot dog will pick it up.
- The dog will then return to the starting point at (25,25) with the ball.
