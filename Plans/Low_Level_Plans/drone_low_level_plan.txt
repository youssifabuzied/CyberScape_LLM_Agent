Since the drone is not required to do anything in this mission, the low-level plan will be empty for the drone. However, I will provide the low-level plan for the robot dog using the given functions for the drone, assuming similar functions exist for the robot dog.

**Low-Level Plan:**

**Phase 1: Initialization**
RobotDog.move_to_point((0,0,0)) // assuming this is the starting point

**Phase 2: Move Forward**
RobotDog.move_forward(2)

**Phase 3: Turn Left**
RobotDog.rotate(90)

**Phase 4: Move Forward**
RobotDog.move_forward(2)

**Phase 5: Turn Left**
RobotDog.rotate(90)

**Phase 6: Move Forward**
RobotDog.move_forward(2)

**Phase 7: Turn Left**
RobotDog.rotate(90)

**Phase 8: Move Forward**
RobotDog.move_forward(2)

**Phase 9: Mission Completion**
RobotDog.communicate_with_apm("Mission Completed")

Note: The above plan assumes that the robot dog has similar functions as the drone. In a real-world scenario, the robot dog would have its own set of functions and APIs that would be used to control its movements.

As for the drone, since it's not required to do anything, the plan would be:

**Low-Level Plan:**

**Phase 1: Idle**
Drone.wait_for_signal() 

This will keep the drone in an idle state, waiting for a signal to continue. However, since there are no further phases, the drone will remain idle throughout the mission.
