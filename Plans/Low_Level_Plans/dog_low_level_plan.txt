Here is the low-level set of executable robot dog instructions:

```
Phase 1:
RobotDog.move_to(25, 25)
if RobotDog.has_reached(25, 25):
    RobotDog.rotate(0) // orient itself to face the direction of the 10x10 meters square
    // idle state to scan the area within a 2-meter radius in all directions (x and y) to detect the ball
    // assume the scanning result is stored in a variable 'ball_detected'
    if ball_detected:
        // proceed to Phase 7 for retrieval and return
        goto Phase 7
    else:
        // proceed to Phase 2
        goto Phase 2

Phase 2:
RobotDog.move_to(27, 25) // move forward by 2 units in the current direction
if RobotDog.has_reached(27, 25):
    // idle state to scan the area within a 2-meter radius in all directions (x and y) to detect the ball
    // assume the scanning result is stored in a variable 'ball_detected'
    if ball_detected:
        // proceed to Phase 7 for retrieval and return
        goto Phase 7
    else:
        RobotDog.rotate(90) // turn left by 90 degrees to prepare for the next side
        // proceed to Phase 3
        goto Phase 3

Phase 3:
RobotDog.move_to(27, 27) // move forward by 2 units in the new direction
if RobotDog.has_reached(27, 27):
    // idle state to scan the area within a 2-meter radius in all directions (x and y) to detect the ball
    // assume the scanning result is stored in a variable 'ball_detected'
    if ball_detected:
        // proceed to Phase 7 for retrieval and return
        goto Phase 7
    else:
        RobotDog.rotate(90) // turn left by 90 degrees to prepare for the next side
        // proceed to Phase 4
        goto Phase 4

Phase 4:
RobotDog.move_to(25, 27) // move forward by 2 units in the new direction
if RobotDog.has_reached(25, 27):
    // idle state to scan the area within a 2-meter radius in all directions (x and y) to detect the ball
    // assume the scanning result is stored in a variable 'ball_detected'
    if ball_detected:
        // proceed to Phase 7 for retrieval and return
        goto Phase 7
    else:
        RobotDog.rotate(90) // turn left by 90 degrees to prepare for the final side
        // proceed to Phase 5
        goto Phase 5

Phase 5:
RobotDog.move_to(25, 25) // move forward by 2 units in the new direction
if RobotDog.has_reached(25, 25):
    // idle state to scan the area within a 2-meter radius in all directions (x and y) to detect the ball
    // assume the scanning result is stored in a variable 'ball_detected'
    if ball_detected:
        // proceed to Phase 7 for retrieval and return
        goto Phase 7
    else:
        // proceed to Phase 6
        goto Phase 6

Phase 6:
RobotDog.move_to(25, 25) // move back to the starting location
if RobotDog.has_reached(25, 25):
    // idle state to re-orient and re-scan the area if necessary
    // assume the re-scanning result is stored in a variable 'ball_detected'
    if ball_detected:
        // proceed to Phase 7 for retrieval and return
        goto Phase 7
    else:
        // communicate with the drone to re-evaluate the 10x10 meters square
        // assume the communication is done
        // end of mission

Phase 7:
// move towards the detected ball location
// assume the ball location is stored in variables 'ball_x' and 'ball_y'
RobotDog.move_to(ball_x, ball_y)
if RobotDog.has_reached(ball_x, ball_y):
    // retrieve the ball
    // assume the ball is retrieved
    // return to the starting location (25, 25) with the ball
    RobotDog.move_to(25, 25)
    if RobotDog.has_reached(25, 25):
        // end of mission
```

Note that I've assumed some variables and functions that are not provided in the original problem statement, such as `ball_detected`, `ball_x`, `ball_y`, and the scanning and retrieval functions. You may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case. Additionally, I've used `goto` statements to jump between phases, but in a real-world implementation, you would likely use a more structured approach, such as function calls or a state machine.
