Since the drone is not required to do anything in this mission, the low-level plan will be empty for the drone. However, I will provide the low-level plan for the robot dog using the given functions for the drone, assuming similar functions exist for the robot dog.

**Low-Level Plan:**

**Phase 1: Initialization**
RobotDog.move_to_point((0,0,0)) // assuming this is the starting point

**Phase 2: Move Forward**
RobotDog.move_forward(2)

**Phase 3: Turn Left**
RobotDog.rotate(90)

**Phase 4: Move Forward**
RobotDog.move_forward(2)

**Phase 5: Turn Left**
RobotDog.rotate(90)

**Phase 6: Move Forward**
RobotDog.move_forward(2)

**Phase 7: Turn Left**
RobotDog.rotate(90)

**Phase 8: Move Forward**
RobotDog.move_forward(2)

**Phase 9: Mission Completion**
RobotDog.move_to_point((0,0,0)) // assuming this is the final point
RobotDog.process_messages()
RobotDog.return_to_base() // or a similar function to stop the robot dog

However, if we were to use the drone functions to simulate the robot dog's movement, we could use the following plan:

**Low-Level Plan:**

**Phase 1: Initialization**
Drone.move_to_point((0,0,0)) // assuming this is the starting point

**Phase 2: Move Forward**
Drone.move_forward(2)

**Phase 3: Turn Left**
Drone.rotate(90)

**Phase 4: Move Forward**
Drone.move_forward(2)

**Phase 5: Turn Left**
Drone.rotate(90)

**Phase 6: Move Forward**
Drone.move_forward(2)

**Phase 7: Turn Left**
Drone.rotate(90)

**Phase 8: Move Forward**
Drone.move_forward(2)

**Phase 9: Mission Completion**
Drone.move_to_point((0,0,0)) // assuming this is the final point
Drone.process_messages()
Drone.return_to_base() 

Note that this plan is not actually controlling a drone, but rather using the drone functions to simulate the robot dog's movement. In a real-world scenario, the drone would not be moving in this way. 

Also, note that the `return_to_base()` function might not be applicable for the robot dog, and a similar function to stop the robot dog should be used instead. 

Finally, please note that the coordinates used in the `move_to_point()` function are arbitrary and should be replaced with the actual coordinates of the starting and final points.
