## 2. Scanning Algorithms for a Grid-Based Area

### 2.1. Coverage Path Planning (CPP)
Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is the process of ensuring that an entire area is fully covered while minimizing redundant movements. It is crucial in robotics applications like vacuum robots, agricultural drones, and underwater exploration vehicles.

### 2.2. Famous Algorithms for Grid-Based Scanning

#### 2.2.1. Spiral Search Algorithm
The spiral search algorithm is used in scenarios where the searcher starts from a central position and expands outward in a spiral pattern to cover the entire area.

##### Implementation
Let's assume a 2D grid where a robot starts scanning from the center and expands outward in a clockwise spiral.

```python
def generate_spiral_path(rows, cols):
    grid = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up
    x, y, d = 0, 0, 0  # Start from the top-left corner
    result = []

    for _ in range(rows * cols):
        result.append((x, y))
        grid[x][y] = 1  # Mark as visited
        nx, ny = x + directions[d][0], y + directions[d][1]

        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 0:
            x, y = nx, ny
        else:
            d = (d + 1) % 4  # Change direction
            x, y = x + directions[d][0], y + directions[d][1]

    return result

# Example usage
rows, cols = 5, 5
spiral_path = generate_spiral_path(rows, cols)
for step in spiral_path:
    print(step)
```

##### Example Output for a 5x5 Grid
```
(0,0) (0,1) (0,2) (0,3) (0,4)
(1,4) (2,4) (3,4) (4,4)
(4,3) (4,2) (4,1) (4,0)
(3,0) (2,0) (1,0)
(1,1) (1,2) (1,3)
(2,3) (3,3)
(3,2) (3,1)
(2,1) (2,2)
```

##### Use Cases
- Used in robotic search operations when the target location is unknown.
- Ideal for underwater and space exploration.
- Used by vacuum robots to ensure full room coverage.

#### 2.2.2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Scanning
BFS explores all possible locations layer by layer, making it ideal for scanning an area with obstacles.

##### Implementation
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_scan(grid, start):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    directions = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        print(f"Scanning: ({x}, {y})")

        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                queue.append((nx, ny))
                visited.add((nx, ny))

# Example Grid (5x5) with starting position at (0,0)
grid = [[0]*5 for _ in range(5)]
bfs_scan(grid, (0,0))
```

##### Use Cases
- Ideal for search and rescue operations where obstacles exist.
- Used in autonomous warehouse robots to scan inventory spaces.

#### 2.2.3. A* Search for Coverage Path Planning
The A* algorithm finds the shortest path while scanning.

##### Implementation
```python
import heapq

def heuristic(a, b):
    return abs(a[0] - b[0]) + abs(a[1] - b[1])

def astar_scan(grid, start, end):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    open_set = [(0, start)]
    came_from = {}
    cost_so_far = {start: 0}

    while open_set:
        _, current = heapq.heappop(open_set)

        if current == end:
            break

        for dx, dy in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]:
            nx, ny = current[0] + dx, current[1] + dy
            if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols:
                new_cost = cost_so_far[current] + 1
                if (nx, ny) not in cost_so_far or new_cost < cost_so_far[(nx, ny)]:
                    cost_so_far[(nx, ny)] = new_cost
                    priority = new_cost + heuristic((nx, ny), end)
                    heapq.heappush(open_set, (priority, (nx, ny)))
                    came_from[(nx, ny)] = current

    return came_from

# Example
grid = [[0]*5 for _ in range(5)]
start, end = (0,0), (4,4)
path = astar_scan(grid, start, end)
print("Path:", path)
```

##### Use Cases
- Used in autonomous drones for efficient area scanning.
- Applied in robotic lawn mowers for optimal grass cutting paths.
