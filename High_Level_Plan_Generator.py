    Phase 1: Take off and navigate to the designated search area.
    Phase 2: Perform a spiral search to scan the entire region.

        {plan}

        Evaluate this plan based on the following rubric:

        - **Logical Soundness (1-10):** Is the plan coherent and free of contradictions?
        - **Feasibility (1-10):** Can the robots execute the tasks given their capabilities?
        - **Completeness (1-10):** Does the plan cover all mission objectives?
        - **Communication Rules (Pass/Fail):** Does the plan respect that all communication happens only via the adaptive planning module?

        Provide a structured response as follows:

        ```
        Rating: [Overall Rating (1-10)]
        Issues Identified:
        - [List any logical, feasibility, or completeness issues]
        - [If the plan violates communication rules, mention it]

        Phase 2: [Provide a clear instruction]
