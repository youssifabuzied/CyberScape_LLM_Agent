Robot Dog Translation Rubric (dog_translation_rubric.txt)
Correctness of Translation

    Does the low-level plan accurately translate each step from the middle-level plan?
    Are all function calls correctly used without modification or misinterpretation?
    Is the sequence of execution preserved exactly as described in the middle-level plan?

Exhaustive Coverage of the Middle-Level Plan

    Does the low-level plan include all steps from the middle-level plan without omission?
    Is every phase of the middle-level plan represented by a corresponding low-level execution block?
    Are all required operations from the middle-level plan fully captured in the low-level instructions?

Adherence to Specified Actions

    Are only the predefined robot dog functions used in the low-level plan?
    Is there any usage of unlisted or assumed functions that are not explicitly provided?
    Does each action in the low-level plan directly correspond to the functions listed in the specifications?

Format Consistency

    Does the low-level plan contain only executable function calls without explanations or comments?
    Is the output structured cleanly without unnecessary text or additional formatting?
    Does the plan maintain a consistent and standardized format throughout?
    Does the generated plan stick only to instructions without adding any notes or comments?
