# Drone Middle-Level Plan Evaluation Rubric

## **1. Correctness of Execution**
- [ ] Does the plan correctly implement all steps required by the high-level plan?
- [ ] Are all phases logically structured to achieve the mission goals?

## **2. Coverage of All Conditions **
- [ ] Does the plan include handling for different possible outcomes (e.g., if a scan detects an object, if it does not)?


## **3. Proper Phase Structuring **
- [ ] Is the plan divided into distinct **phases**, where each phase represents a complete, independent step in the mission?
- [ ] Does each phase execute **only after confirming the previous one is completed**?
- [ ] Are any unnecessary dependencies or incorrect sequencing present?
