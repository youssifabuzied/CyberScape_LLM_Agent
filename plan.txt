Drone Plan:
Phase 1: Do nothing
Phase 2: Do nothing

Dog Plan:
Phase 1: Rotate 45 degrees clockwise
Phase 2: Move forward 10 units
Phase 3: Rotate 135 degrees clockwise
Phase 4: Move forward 10 units
Phase 5: Rotate 135 degrees clockwise
Phase 6: Move forward 10 units
Phase 7: Rotate 135 degrees clockwise
Phase 8: Move forward 10 units
Phase 9: Rotate 135 degrees clockwise
Phase 10: Move forward 10 units
Phase 11: Rotate 135 degrees clockwise
Phase 12: Move forward 10 units
Phase 13: Rotate 135 degrees clockwise
Phase 14: Move forward 10 units
Phase 15: Rotate 45 degrees clockwise 

However, since the octagon is symmetric, we can simplify the phases as follows:

Dog Plan:
Phase 1: Rotate 45 degrees clockwise
Phase 2-15: 
    For i = 1 to 8
    Move forward 10 units
    Rotate 135 degrees clockwise
    End for 
Phase 16: Rotate 45 degrees clockwise
