Drone Plan:
Phase 1: Start at point (5,5) and divide the 50x50 meters field into 25 squares of 10x10 meters each. Create a grid to represent these squares and assign a unique identifier to each square.
Phase 2: Systematically fly over each square in a zig-zag pattern, starting from the top left square (0,0) and moving right, then down, then left, and so on. At each square, use sensors to detect the presence of the ball.
Phase 3: Once the ball is detected in a 10x10 meters square, record the square's identifier and coordinates (x, y) of the square's center. Send a message to the adaptive planning module to inform the robot dog about the ball's location. If the ball is not detected after scanning all squares, send a failure message to the adaptive planning module.
Phase 4: Wait for confirmation from the adaptive planning module that the robot dog has received the message and is moving towards the ball's location.

Dog Plan:
Phase 1: Start at point (25,25) and wait for a message from the adaptive planning module about the ball's location. Once received, move towards the center of the 10x10 meters square where the ball is located. If a failure message is received, terminate the mission.
Phase 2: Upon arriving at the square, initiate a spiral search algorithm to scan the 10x10 meters area. Start at the center of the square and move in a spiral pattern, scanning 2 meters in all directions at each step.
Phase 3: Continue the spiral search until the ball is detected. Once detected, move towards the ball and pick it up. If the ball is not detected after scanning the entire 10x10 meters area, send a failure message to the adaptive planning module.
Phase 4: After picking up the ball, move back to the starting point (25,25) and send a message to the adaptive planning module to confirm the mission's completion.

Spiral Search Algorithm:
- Start at the center of the 10x10 meters square (x, y).
- Move 2 meters in the x-direction (east) and scan the area.
- Move 2 meters in the y-direction (north) and scan the area.
- Move 2 meters in the x-direction (west) and scan the area.
- Move 2 meters in the y-direction (south) and scan the area.
- Continue this pattern, increasing the distance from the center by 2 meters at each step, until the ball is detected or the entire 10x10 meters area is scanned.
