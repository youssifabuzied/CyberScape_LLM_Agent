Drone Plan:
Phase 1: Divide the 50x50 meters field into 25 squares of 10x10 meters each and assign a unique identifier to each square.
Phase 2: Start scanning the squares in a systematic order (e.g., left to right, top to bottom), beginning from the top-left square (0,0).
Phase 3: Once the drone detects the ball in a square, communicate the identifier of that square to the robot dog through the adaptive planning module and stop scanning.

Dog Plan:
Phase 1: Wait for the message from the drone with the identifier of the 10x10 meters square containing the ball.
Phase 2: Move to the center of the identified square and start scanning the area in a spiral search pattern, beginning from the center and moving outwards in 2-meter increments.
Phase 3: Continue scanning until the ball is detected within the 2-meter scanning range.
Phase 4: Once the ball is detected, move towards it and pick it up.
Phase 5: Return to the starting point (25,25) with the ball.
Phase 6: If the ball is not detected after scanning the entire square, notify the drone and wait for further instructions.

Spiral Search Algorithm (for Dog) remains the same.
