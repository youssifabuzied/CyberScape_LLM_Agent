Drone Plan:
Phase 1: Start at point (5,5) and divide the 50x50 meters field into 25 squares of 10x10 meters each. Create a grid to represent these squares and assign a unique identifier to each square.
Phase 2: Systematically fly over each square in a zig-zag pattern, starting from the top left square (0,0) and moving right, then down, then left, and so on. At each square, use sensors to determine if the ball is present.
Phase 3: If the ball is detected in a square, record the square's identifier and send a message to the adaptive planning module with the identifier.
Phase 4: Continue scanning the remaining squares until the entire field has been covered or a message is received from the adaptive planning module to stop scanning.

Dog Plan:
Phase 1: Start at point (25,25) and wait for a message from the adaptive planning module with the identifier of the 10x10 meters square containing the ball.
Phase 2: Upon receiving the message, move to the center of the identified square and start a spiral search algorithm to scan the area. The spiral search will involve moving in a circular pattern, starting from the center and increasing the radius by 2 meters after each complete circle.
Phase 3: Continue the spiral search until the ball is detected. Once detected, move to the ball's location and pick it up.
Phase 4: After picking up the ball, navigate back to the starting point (25,25) using a shortest path algorithm.

Spiral Search Algorithm:
- Start at the center of the square (x, y)
- Set the initial radius to 2 meters
- Move in a circular pattern around the center, scanning the area within the current radius
- If the ball is not detected, increase the radius by 2 meters and repeat the circular pattern
- Continue increasing the radius and scanning until the ball is detected or the entire square has been covered

Adaptive Planning Module:
- Receive messages from the drone with the identifier of the square containing the ball
- Send messages to the dog with the identifier of the square containing the ball
- Receive messages from the dog when the ball has been picked up and the mission is complete
