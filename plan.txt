Drone Plan:
Phase 1: Fly to point (0,0) and start scanning the 10x10 meters square area.
Phase 2: If the ball is not found, move 10 meters to the right (east direction) and scan the next 10x10 meters square area.
Phase 3: Continue moving 10 meters to the right and scanning until the entire row is covered.
Phase 4: Move 10 meters up (north direction) and repeat phases 2-3 until the entire field is covered.
Phase 5: Once the ball is located within a 10x10 meters square, communicate the coordinates to the robot dog.

Dog Plan:
Phase 1: Start at point (25,25) and receive the coordinates of the 10x10 meters square containing the ball from the drone.
Phase 2: Move to the center of the 10x10 meters square and start scanning the area using a spiral search algorithm:
    - Start at the center point and move 2 meters in a straight line (e.g., north direction).
    - Turn 90 degrees (e.g., east direction) and move 2 meters.
    - Continue turning 90 degrees and moving 2 meters in a spiral pattern, increasing the distance by 2 meters each time.
Phase 3: Continue the spiral search until the ball is found.
Phase 4: Once the ball is found, pick it up and return to the starting point (25,25).
