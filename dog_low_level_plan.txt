To convert the middle-level plan into a low-level set of executable robot dog instructions, we need to break down each phase into specific movements and actions using the provided functions. Here's the converted plan:

**Phase 1: Move Forward to Form the First Side of the Square**

```
Phase 1:
RobotDog.move_to(2,0)  # Move forward by 2 units
if RobotDog.has_reached(2,0):
    RobotDog.idle()  # Wait until the movement is complete
```

**Phase 2: Turn Left to Prepare for the Next Side**

```
Phase 2:
RobotDog.rotate(90)  # Turn left by 90 degrees
RobotDog.idle()  # Wait until the rotation is complete
```

**Phase 3: Move Forward to Form the Second Side of the Square**

```
Phase 3:
RobotDog.move_to(2,2)  # Move forward by 2 units
if RobotDog.has_reached(2,2):
    RobotDog.idle()  # Wait until the movement is complete
```

**Phase 4: Turn Left to Prepare for the Next Side**

```
Phase 4:
RobotDog.rotate(90)  # Turn left by 90 degrees
RobotDog.idle()  # Wait until the rotation is complete
```

**Phase 5: Move Forward to Form the Third Side of the Square**

```
Phase 5:
RobotDog.move_to(0,2)  # Move forward by 2 units
if RobotDog.has_reached(0,2):
    RobotDog.idle()  # Wait until the movement is complete
```

**Phase 6: Turn Left to Prepare for the Final Side**

```
Phase 6:
RobotDog.rotate(90)  # Turn left by 90 degrees
RobotDog.idle()  # Wait until the rotation is complete
```

**Phase 7: Move Forward to Complete the Square and Return to the Starting Point**

```
Phase 7:
RobotDog.move_to(0,0)  # Move forward by 2 units to return to the starting point
if RobotDog.has_reached(0,0):
    RobotDog.idle()  # Wait until the movement is complete
```

Note that the `move_to` function is used to move the robot dog to specific coordinates, and the `rotate` function is used to turn the robot dog by a specified angle. The `idle` function is used to wait until the movement or rotation is complete. The `has_reached` function is used to verify that the robot dog has reached the desired coordinates before proceeding to the next phase.
